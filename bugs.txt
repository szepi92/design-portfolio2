bugs:
	1 top menu lights up a little too late and takes you a little too down 
	2 when the top bar is fixed the pages should not take up the full 
		browser height but rather browser height - topbar
		this would fix bug1
		
	3 Internet explorer - weird blue line in main landing image
	4 Internet explorer - random white space at the bottom of the page
