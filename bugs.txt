bugs:
	1 top menu lights up a little too late and takes you a little too down 
	2 when the top bar is fixed the pages should not take up the full 
		browser height but rather browser height - topbar
		this would fix bug1
		
	3 Internet explorer - weird blue line in main landing image
	4 Internet explorer - random white space at the bottom of the page
	
	5 project pages are slightly too big - maybe fix it once 2nd nav bar has been added
	
	6 when vertically centered with additional div, skills are not responsive to wide screens
	
	7 big white space between projects on mobile
	8 text under project cut off on mobile (margin on the bottom of the page doubles in size as screen gets narrow?)
	
enhancements
	1 add sticky page plugin if not buggy
	2 add swipe capabilities for touchscreen
